Since 2017, I have been acting as a Line Manager. Most of my managees and other fellow colleagues, ask me this question, "How to be a good leader". This time I planned to gather all points 
here for future refrences. There could be many more but these are the one I practise in project since 2014.

* A great leader isn't one who holds a candle up for others, but helps them light their candles instead.

* Be decisive: realize that sometimes it's not that the best decision is made but that a decision is made timely.

* Positive reinforcement, notice and recognize achievements and improvements, no matter how small, people work harder for people that notice their successes and work just enough for people who only notice their failures.

* Be the worker you want others to be, lead by example. Volunteer yourself to do projects.

* <strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Don't fear being wrong, say you were and move on. Don't let people think that you shift blame to others or are incapable of recognizing your own failures. 

* Be honest to those below you (in terms of feedback) and open about the reasons behind your decisions, you have to admit your mistakes as well.. 

* Be a buffer for them, from your boss.

* It's about getting your team to work together, not about goals and targets. (Though you should have them.) Make time to listen to them.

* Ask for help, hopefully you're not the only one. If you are having trouble reach out, people will respect you for it, not think less of you, you may inspire them to do the same. Ask for advice, 

* Be accountable to those below you.

* Be human. Your team will feel more comfortable asking for help and letting you know when things go wrong.

* Empathy is a good leadership quality
